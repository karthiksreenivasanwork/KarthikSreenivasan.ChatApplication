## User Interface

- Simple interface that accepts the name and the chat message.
  - To emulate multiple users, we have to open the node server on multiple tabs and each tab will be considered a separate user by the application.
  - The socket.io is an event-driven JavaScript library that updates the chat messages to all the web clients.
